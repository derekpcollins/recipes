		"description": "The sweet potato is a nutritional powerhouse; they are a good source of fiber, vitamins such as Vitamin B and C, as well as minerals like calcium and potassium. They are also known for their antioxidant, beta-carotene which helps with healthy skin, helps with our immunity and overall good health. What do you put on a baked sweet potato if you choose to enjoy it by itself? I like to top it just like I would top a regular baked potato. A little butter and sour cream is so delicious!",
